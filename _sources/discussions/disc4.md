# Modules over a ring

Today we went over some basics definitions related to modules,
and defined free modules over a ring $R$. The material I decided to cover today
was intended to give us precisely the knowledge we need to solve the 
qualifying exam problems I have selected. On Wednesday next week I'll plan 
to talk a little bit about tensor products.
