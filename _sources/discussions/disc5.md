# Tensor Products

Today we had a crash course in tensor products. I opted for a more
category-theoretic introduction, which has the benefit of being a little
cleaner to look at, but maybe more mysterious depending on how much 
category theory you've seen. For the qual, the starred facts are what
I think are important to know. It is also worth checking in with 
Professor about whether or not the Fall Qual will have tensor products.
