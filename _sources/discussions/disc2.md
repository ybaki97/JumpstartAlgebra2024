Today we got through the definitions and did a few problems together.
Email me with any special topics you'd like to see next week. We can 
move on to rings, modules, and fields as we'd like :) I'm going to 
also try and make an online forum for us to discuss qual problems. 
Recording from today will be sent via email.
